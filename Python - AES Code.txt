This code uses the AES.new() function to create a new AES object, which is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. 

The key and iv variables should be set to your desired key and initialization vector, respectively. 

The key should be a byte string of length 16, 24, or 32, and the IV should be a byte string of length 16.

The pad() and unpad() functions are used to ensure that the data is a multiple of the block size (16 bytes) before encrypting and after decrypting.

The encrypt() function takes plaintext as input and returns the encrypted ciphertext. 

The decrypt() function takes ciphertext as input and returns the decrypted plaintext.

To use this code, you will need to install the pycryptodome library. You can do this by running the following command:


pip install pycryptodome
