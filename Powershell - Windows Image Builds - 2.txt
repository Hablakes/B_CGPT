You will need to modify the script to specify the path to the image file and the drive letter of the USB drive. You will also need to create a diskpart.txt file with the following commands:


Copy code
select disk 1
clean
create partition primary
select partition 1
active
format fs=ntfs quick
assign
exit


This file should be placed in the same directory as the script and the path should be modified in the script to point to the correct location.
