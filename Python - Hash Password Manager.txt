First, you will need to create a dictionary to store your passwords. The dictionary should have the form {website: password}.

Next, you will need to create a function that generates a strong, random password for a given website. You can use Python's secrets module to generate a secure random password.

You will also need a function that allows you to add a new password to the dictionary. This function should take a website and a password as input and add them to the dictionary.

To encrypt the dictionary, you can use a symmetric key and Python's cryptography library. First, you will need to generate a secret key and create a cipher object using the key. Then, you can use the encrypt method of the cipher object to encrypt the dictionary.

To decrypt the dictionary, you will need to create another cipher object using the same secret key and use the decrypt method of the cipher object to decrypt the encrypted dictionary.

Finally, you will need a function that retrieves the password for a given website from the decrypted dictionary. This function should take a website as input and return the corresponding password.

Here's some sample code that illustrates how these functions might work:


import secrets
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

# Generate a secret key
key = Fernet.generate_key()

# Create a cipher object using the secret key
cipher = Fernet(key)

# Create a dictionary to store passwords
passwords = {}

def generate_password(website):
  """Generate a strong, random password for a given website"""
  return secrets.token_hex(16)

def add_password(website, password):
  """Add a new password to the dictionary"""
  passwords[website] = password

def encrypt_passwords():
  """Encrypt the password dictionary using the cipher object"""
  encrypted_passwords = cipher.encrypt(passwords.encode())
  return encrypted_passwords

def decrypt_passwords(encrypted_passwords):
  """Decrypt the encrypted password dictionary using the cipher object"""
  decrypted_passwords = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_passwords).decode()
  return decrypted_passwords

def get_password(website):
  """Retrieve the password for a given website from the decrypted dictionary"""
  return passwords[website]
