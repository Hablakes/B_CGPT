To find tickets in Autotask where the work type is "Cloud Based IT" but the time entry is above 30 minutes, you can use the Autotask API and a programming language such as Python. Here is an example of how you could do this:

Install the Autotask API Python library by running the following command:

pip install autotask_api

Import the necessary libraries and authenticate with the Autotask API:

import autotask_api

client = autotask_api.Client(
    integration_id='YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID',
    integration_key='YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY',
    user_name='YOUR_USER_NAME',
    password='YOUR_PASSWORD',
    server='https://webservices.autotask.net/atservices/1.5/atws.wsdl'
)

Query the Autotask database to retrieve the tickets that meet the criteria you specified:

query = "SELECT Ticket.ID, Ticket.WorkType, TicketTime.TimeEntered FROM Ticket INNER JOIN TicketTime ON Ticket.ID = TicketTime.TicketID WHERE Ticket.WorkType = 'Cloud Based IT' AND TicketTime.TimeEntered > 1800"

response = client.query(query)
tickets = response['entities']
Iterate through the list of tickets and print the ticket ID and time entered for each one:
Copy code
for ticket in tickets:
    ticket_id = ticket['Ticket']['ID']['value']
    time_entered = ticket['TicketTime']['TimeEntered']['value']
    print(f"Ticket ID: {ticket_id}, Time entered: {time_entered}")

Save the file with a .py extension, such as report.py.

Run the script using the following command:

python report.py

This will print a list of tickets where the work type is "Cloud Based IT" but the time entry is above 30 minutes.
