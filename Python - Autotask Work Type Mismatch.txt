To create a report in Autotask to find tickets where the work type does not match the resource type, you can use the Autotask API and a programming language such as Python. Here is an example of how you could do this:

Install the Autotask API Python library by running the following command:

pip install autotask_api

Import the necessary libraries and authenticate with the Autotask API:

import autotask_api

client = autotask_api.Client(
    integration_id='YOUR_INTEGRATION_ID',
    integration_key='YOUR_INTEGRATION_KEY',
    user_name='YOUR_USER_NAME',
    password='YOUR_PASSWORD',
    server='https://webservices.autotask.net/atservices/1.5/atws.wsdl'
)

Query the Autotask database to retrieve the tickets that meet the criteria you specified:
Copy code

query = "SELECT WorkType.Name, Resource.Type FROM Ticket WHERE WorkType.Name <> Resource.Type"

response = client.query(query)
tickets = response['entities']
Iterate through the list of tickets and print the work type and resource type for each one:
Copy code
for ticket in tickets:
    work_type = ticket['WorkType']['Name']['value']
    resource_type = ticket['Resource']['Type']['value']
    print(f"Work type: {work_type}, Resource type: {resource_type}")

Save the file with a .py extension, such as report.py.

Run the script using the following command:

python report.py

This will print a list of tickets where the work type does not match the resource type.
